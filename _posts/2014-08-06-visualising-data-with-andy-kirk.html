    <p>This evening I attended a Visualising Data meetup hosted by the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Business-Analytics-Group" target="_blank">London Business Analytics Group</a> featuring <a href="http://twitter.com/visualisingdata" target="_blank">Andy Kirk</a>; a data visualisation specialist. Andy explained his views on tackling data visualisation jobs and the process he goes through when thinking of the best way to convey data in a meaningful way. Data visualisation is large part of my job and seeing Andy go through his techniques of turning data into useful, actionable information was very interesting to see. I very much liked how he explained the hidden art in the amount of decisions made in good examples of data visualisation; every colour and font-size makes a difference.</p>
    <p>Talking to Andy after his presentation, he mentioned quite a few tools such as <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/" target="_blank">Tableau</a>, <a href="http://raw.densitydesign.org" target="_blank">RAW</a>, <a href="http://www.ometria.com" target="_blank">Ometria</a> and <a href="http://rjmetrics.com/product" target="_blank">RJMetrics</a> but explained how there really is a lack of multi-purpose tools out there for designers. He explained how most visualisation projects start off by passing the data into a tool like Tableau where users can interact with the data quickly to find interesting insights which are then artistically drawn up in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html" target="_blank">Illustrator</a> manually.</p>
    <p>Since the meeting I have been reading his book on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00ATYE3YG" target="_blank">Data Visualization: a successful design process</a> which gives a brilliant thought-process to follow when working on data visualisation jobs. His views on the balance between art and science really makes a lot of sense and the examples used throughout the book provide a good resource to go back to when brainstorming.</p>
