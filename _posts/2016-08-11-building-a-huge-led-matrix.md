Recently I worked on a side project where I built a wearable camera out of a Rasperry Pi. I had previously bought a [Narrative Clip](http://getnarrative.com) and was a little disappointed by quality and knew hacking together my own solution could be possible. I was also about to go on a holiday where I would be traveling to 4 countries in 5 days, so the timing was perfect.
