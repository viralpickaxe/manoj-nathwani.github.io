    <p>This Christmas I got a really neat <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00NLOK0RK" target="_blank">Arduino Car Kit</a> off Amazon which I jumped on straight away to start building. I’ve tried building a car exactly like this in the past however it was simply a card board box with two motors which didn’t even have enough power to push itself with an Arduino Uno in it, so this kit was exactly what I needed. In particular were the motor driver and battery box which when used together could power motors to carry a surprising amount of weight!</p>

    <p>To start off with I used an Arduino Uno to test that everything was working with the L298N Motor Driver which is quite self-explanatory and makes life very easy for programming the motors. You can find instructions on how to use it <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Modules-L298N-Dual-H-Bridge-Motor-Controll/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p>My next step was to swap out the Arduino for an Intel Edison which would allow me to use its on-board WiFi to host a webserver which I could talk to, to control the car. I loaded up the <a href="https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/WiFi/examples/SimpleWebServerWiFi/SimpleWebServerWiFi.ino" target="_blank">SimpleWebServerWiFi</a> sample code and made it appropriate for controlling my car as well as writing up a the HTML and Javascript needed to make a live website which you could use your keyboard to send commands to the car with. I also added an LED which lights up once the webserver is live and ready for instructions as well as a horn which was made using a buzzer.</p>

    <p>An interesting problem which occurred was that the Lumia 1020 phone I was using as the camera was incredibly heavy and was toppling the car whenever it reversed, after hours of re-engineering and shifting around the centre of gravity I finally fixed it by moving the power charger (the cylinder) to the very back of the car and building a bumper out of Meccano and adding it to the front which would stop it tilting. I also managed to strap the phone very tightly to the car which worked out very well and works by having a skype call running with my laptop via WiFi.</p>

    <p>I also made use of a breadboard to avoid wasting power by having the motor controller continuously connected, the Edison can also be turned off by disconnecting it from the power charger. All-in-all this was a great project which lasted a good three days over the Christmas break. View the code below.</p>
